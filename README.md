This review is intended to provide a brief overview of the key concepts and ideas discussed in the book and is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to everything included in the original work. If you're looking for a refresher on the basics of Ethereum and its potential applications, this review may be useful. However, we encourage you to read the original book for a more in-depth understanding of the topics covered. With that in mind, let's dive into our review of "Mastering Ethereum."

#  Chapter 1 - What Is Ethereum
### Introduction To Blockchain And Ethereum
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that allows for the secure, transparent, and immutable recording of transactions. It was first introduced as the underlying technology behind the digital currency Bitcoin in 2008.

Ethereum is a decentralized and distributed blockchain platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. It was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and cryptocurrency researcher.

Ethereum is different from Bitcoin(which is a blockchain) in several ways. Whereas Bitcoin was designed to be a digital currency, Ethereum was designed to be a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). This means that Ethereum has its own programming language, called Solidity, which allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts.

Ethereum has several key components, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which runs smart contracts, and the Ethereum network, which allows for the peer-to-peer exchange of value. It also has a native cryptocurrency called Ether, which is used to pay transaction fees and is traded on various exchanges.

Ethereum is said to be Turing complete, which means that it can perform any computation that a classical computer can perform, given enough time and memory. This property allows for the flexibility and expressiveness of the Solidity programming language.

Ethereum's support for smart contracts and dApps has made it a popular platform for a wide range of applications, from supply chain management to gaming and prediction markets. Many developers and businesses are building on Ethereum, attracted by its potential to create new and innovative decentralized solutions.

Ethereum has four development stages: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis, and Serenity. These stages represent the different phases of development and deployment of the Ethereum platform and its features.

#  Chapter 2 - Ethereum Basics
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. It was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and cryptocurrency researcher.

Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, called Ether, which is used to pay transaction fees and is traded on various exchanges. The smallest unit of Ether is called a Wei, and 1 Ether is equal to 10^18 Wei.

When using Ethereum, it's important to choose a secure wallet to store your Ether and other cryptocurrencies. There are various types of wallets available, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and paper wallets.

Ethereum is sometimes referred to as the "world computer" because it allows for the decentralized execution of code. This means that applications built on Ethereum can run on a global network of nodes, without the need for a central authority.

Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs), which are controlled by private keys, and contract accounts, which are controlled by code. EOAs are used by users to interact with the Ethereum network, while contract accounts are used to deploy and run smart contracts.

In conclusion, Ethereum is a powerful platform for building decentralized applications and enabling new forms of digital interaction. Its smart contract technology and native cryptocurrency, Ether, have the potential to disrupt traditional business models and create new opportunities for individuals and businesses.

# Chapter 3 - Ethereum Clients
Ethereum clients are software programs that implement the Ethereum protocol and allow users to interact with the Ethereum network. Some examples of Ethereum clients include Geth, Parity, and Ethereum Wallet.

Ethereum networks are collections of Ethereum nodes that are connected to each other and can exchange information and data. The main Ethereum network is the main public network, where users can transact and deploy smart contracts. There are also other networks, such as the Rinkeby, Goerli, and Sepolia test networks, where users can test their applications without using real Ether.

Ethereum nodes are computers that are running an Ethereum client and are connected to the Ethereum network. They are responsible for validating transactions and blocks, and for storing and synchronizing the Ethereum blockchain. To run an Ethereum node, you will need a computer with at least 4GB of RAM and a stable internet connection.

Ethereum clients are typically written in the programming language Go, although other languages, such as Rust and Java, are also used.

Remote Ethereum clients, also known as web3 providers, allow users to access the Ethereum network from a remote location, such as a web browser or a mobile device. This makes it easier for users to interact with the Ethereum network and deploy and use dApps without having to run a full node.

# Chapter 4 - Cryptography
Cryptography is a fundamental component of blockchain and Ethereum technology. It allows for the secure, transparent, and immutable recording of transactions on the blockchain.

Cryptography involves the use of mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data. In blockchain and Ethereum, cryptography is used to create unique keys and addresses for users and to verify the authenticity and integrity of transactions.

Public key cryptography is a type of cryptography that uses a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key is available to anyone, while the private key is known only to the owner.

In cryptocurrency, the public key is used to generate a unique address, which is used to receive funds. The private key is used to sign transactions and prove ownership of the funds associated with a given address.

Private keys are generated using a secure random number generator, and are typically represented as a long string of characters. They are crucial to the security of a cryptocurrency wallet, as they are the only way to access and spend the funds associated with a given address.

Public keys are derived from private keys using complex mathematical algorithms, such as elliptic curve cryptography. They are used to generate unique addresses and to verify the authenticity of transactions.

Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of public key cryptography that is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves. It is widely used in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, as it offers high levels of security and efficiency.

Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical algorithms that take input data of any size and produce a fixed-size output, called a hash. The main properties of cryptographic hash functions are collision resistance, which means that it is difficult to find two input data that produce the same hash, and one-wayness, which means that it is difficult to recreate the input data from the hash.

Ethereum uses the Keccak-256 cryptographic hash function to generate hashes for transactions and blocks on the blockchain.

An Ethereum address is a unique identifier that is associated with an Ethereum account. It is derived from the public key using the Keccak-256 hash function and is typically represented as a string of 40 hexadecimal characters. Ethereum addresses are used to receive and send Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. They can also be used to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum platform.

# Chapter 5 - Wallets
Ethereum wallets are software programs that allow users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. They are used to store, send, and receive Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, as well as other Ethereum-based tokens.

There are two main types of Ethereum wallets: nondeterministic (random) wallets and deterministic (seeded) wallets. Nondeterministic wallets generate a new, random address for each transaction, while deterministic wallets use a set of pre-generated addresses based on a seed value.

Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets are a type of deterministic wallet that use a tree-like structure to generate addresses. This allows them to use a single seed value to generate an unlimited number of addresses, while still allowing the user to maintain control over their funds. HD wallets are specified by BIP-32 and BIP-44.

Seeds and mnemonic codes are used to generate the seed value for HD wallets. Seeds are typically a string of randomly generated words, while mnemonic codes are a human-readable representation of the seed. BIP-39 specifies a standard for mnemonic codes, which can be used to generate seeds for HD wallets.

When using an Ethereum wallet, it's important to follow best practices to ensure the safety of your funds. This includes keeping your seed value and mnemonic code secure, backing up your wallet regularly, and using a hardware wallet for added security.

In conclusion, Ethereum wallets are essential tools for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and managing your ETH and other tokens. They come in different forms and offer varying levels of security, so it's important to choose the right wallet for your needs and follow best practices to keep your funds safe.

#  Chapter 6 - Transactions
Ethereum transactions are the core component of the Ethereum network, allowing for the transfer of value and data between accounts. Understanding the structure and components of a transaction is crucial for anyone working with or using the Ethereum network.

The structure of an Ethereum transaction consists of several components, including the transaction nonce, gas, recipient, value, and data. A nonce is a unique number that ensures the transaction is processed in the correct order within the blockchain. Keeping track of nonces is essential to prevent gaps or duplicate nonces, which can cause errors in the transaction process.

Once a transaction is sent, it must go through confirmation by the network before it is considered complete. This process ensures the transaction is valid and not a duplicate.

Transaction gas is the fee paid by the sender for the computation and storage of the transaction on the Ethereum network. The recipient is the address of the account receiving the value or data in the transaction. The value is the amount of Ether being transferred, while the data payload can contain information or instructions for the recipient EOA (Externally Owned Account) or contract.

Transactions can also be used to transmit value and data to EOAs and contracts. In the case of transmitting value and/or data payload, the recipient can be either an EOA or a contract.

A special transaction called contract creation allows for the deployment of a new contract onto the Ethereum network. This transaction contains the contract code and initial values for the contract's storage.

Ethereum transactions use digital signatures for security and authenticity. The ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is the cryptographic algorithm used for Ethereum digital signatures. It works by generating a unique signature for each transaction using the private key of the sender and the transaction data. This signature is then verified by the network using the sender's public key.

In conclusion, understanding the structure and components of an Ethereum transaction is essential for anyone working with the Ethereum network. Properly tracking and using nonces, understanding transaction fees and recipients, and utilizing digital signatures all play a crucial role in successful transactions on the Ethereum network.

#  Chapter 7 - Smart Contracts and Solidity
Ethereum smart contracts are digital contracts that allow for self-executing, autonomous transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This code is executed on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures that the contract is executed exactly as it is written and cannot be altered once deployed.

Solidity is a high-level programming language that is used to write Ethereum smart contracts. It is similar to other object-oriented languages like JavaScript and C++. Solidity allows developers to write complex, scalable, and secure smart contracts that can be executed on the Ethereum network.

The syntax of Solidity is similar to other programming languages, with variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. It also has specific features like contract definitions, state variables, and event triggers that are unique to smart contract development.

To deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum network, it must first be compiled into bytecode that is understood by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is done using a Solidity compiler like Solc. The compiled bytecode, along with the Application Binary Interface (ABI) that defines the contract's functions and variables, is then deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

#  Chapter 8 - Smart Contracts and Vyper
Vyper is a promising language for writing Ethereum smart contracts due to its focus on simplicity and security. While it may not have all the capabilities of Solidity, its straightforward syntax and enhanced security make it a valuable tool for developers working on the Ethereum platform.

Vyper is a programming language specifically designed for writing Ethereum smart contracts. It is a relatively new language, with a focus on simplicity and security.

One of the vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts is the possibility of "reentrancy attacks," where an attacker can repeatedly call a contract's function in order to drain its funds. Vyper addresses this vulnerability by not allowing for reentrancy.

In comparison to Solidity, the most commonly used language for writing Ethereum smart contracts, Vyper is more limited in terms of features and capabilities. However, this simplicity makes Vyper contracts easier to read and audit, which can improve their security.

When writing data to the Ethereum blockchain using Vyper, it is important to carefully consider the data types and structure of the information being stored. This will ensure that the data can be properly accessed and utilized by the smart contract.

#  Chapter 9 - Smart Contract Security
One of the key concerns with smart contracts is their security. As with any code, smart contracts can contain vulnerabilities and bugs that can be exploited by attackers. Therefore, it is crucial to follow best practices and implement preventive measures to ensure the security of smart contracts.

Some security best practices for smart contracts include:

1. Using well-tested and audited libraries and frameworks
2. Implementing proper access controls and restrictions
3. Regularly testing and reviewing the code
4. Using secure programming languages and coding standards
5. Implementing security measures such as threat modeling and penetration testing

Security risks and antipatterns in smart contracts include:
1. Lack of proper access controls, leading to unauthorized access to the contract
2. Unchecked input parameters, allowing for malicious input to be passed to the contract
3. Vulnerable code, leading to potential exploits and attacks
4. Inadequate testing and review, leading to undetected vulnerabilities

Examples of preventative techniques for smart contract security include:
1. Using the OpenZeppelin library for secure contract development
2. Implementing the access control pattern for proper access control
3. Regularly conducting security audits and penetration testing

Code examples in Solidity:
```solidity
// Use the OpenZeppelin library for secure contract development
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// Implement access control pattern for proper access control
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
  mapping (address => bool) public isAdmin;

  function onlyAdmin() internal view {
    require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "Only admin can perform this action");
  }

  // Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing
  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public onlyAdmin {
    // Transfer tokens only if the caller is an admin
    require(_to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
    require(_value <= balanceOf(msg.sender), "Insufficient balance");
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
  }
  ...........
}
``` 
The security of smart contracts is crucial for the success of decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. By following security best practices, implementing preventative techniques, and regularly conducting audits and testing, developers can ensure the security of their smart contracts and protect against potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

#  Chapter 10 - Tokens
Ethereum Tokens are digital assets that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. They are often used to represent real-world assets or to represent the value of a particular project or organization. Ethereum Tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a means of payment, to raise funds for a project, or as a way to reward users for their participation in a network.

One of the most common use cases for Ethereum Tokens is as a means of fundraising, through a process known as an initial coin offering (ICO). In an ICO, a project will issue a set number of tokens and sell them to investors, who can then use the tokens to access the project’s services or to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Tokens on Ethereum can be either fungible or non-fungible. Fungible tokens are interchangeable, meaning that any token of the same type is worth the same as any other. Examples of fungible tokens include stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value, and cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique and cannot be exchanged for other tokens of the same type. Examples of non-fungible tokens include collectible items, such as digital art or virtual real estate.

Token standards are the rules and guidelines that govern how Ethereum Tokens are created and used. The most commonly used token standard is the ERC20 standard, which defines a set of rules for creating and using tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC721 standard is a newer standard that is specifically designed for creating non-fungible tokens.

The Solidity programming language is commonly used to create Ethereum Tokens. The following is an example of a Solidity code for creating an ERC20 token:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyToken {
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint8 public decimals;
    uint public totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;

    constructor() public {
        name = "MyToken";
        symbol = "MTK";
        decimals = 18;
        totalSupply = 1000000000000000000;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value && _value > 0);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    }
 ...........
}
```
To learn more about the EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) that govern Ethereum Tokens, you can visit the Ethereum website (https://ethereum.org/en/developers/eips/) and browse the list of EIPs.

In conclusion, Ethereum Tokens are digital assets that are built on the Ethereum blockchain and can be used for a variety of purposes, including fundraising and as a means of payment. Token standards and data structures, such as the ERC20 and ERC721 standards, provide the rules and guidelines for creating and using tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is a commonly used programming language for creating Ethereum Tokens, and the Ethereum website offers a wealth of information about the EIPs that govern their use.

# Chapter 11: Oracles
Ethereum oracles are a way to bring external data into a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. They are often used to enable smart contracts to interact with external systems, such as data feeds, APIs, and other off-chain resources.

One common use case for oracles is in the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which often need to access real-world data such as exchange rates or the weather. Oracles can also be used in other applications, such as supply chain management, where the smart contract must know the status of a shipment before it can release payment.

Oracles are typically implemented using a design pattern known as "request-response,"  in which the smart contract sends a request for data to the oracle, which then retrieves the data and sends a response back to the contract.

There are several different types of oracles, including centralized oracles, which are operated by a single entity; decentralized oracles, which are operated by a network of participants; and hybrid oracles, which combine elements of both centralized and decentralized design.

Some examples of oracles include Chainlink, which is a decentralized oracle network, and Oraclize, which offers both centralized and decentralized oracle services.

In conclusion, Ethereum oracles are an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem, as they allow smart contracts to access external data and interact with the real world. They are used in a variety of applications and come in different types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

# Chapter 12: Decentralized Applications (DApps)
Ethereum Decentralized Applications, or DApps, are applications that run on a decentralized network using blockchain technology. They are designed to be open, transparent, and resistant to censorship or interference.

One of the main advantages of creating a DApp is that it can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection. This means that users can interact with the application without needing to trust a single entity, such as a company or government.

DApps are typically composed of three main components: a user interface, a smart contract, and a decentralized network. The user interface allows users to interact with the DApp, the smart contract defines the rules and logic of the DApp, and the decentralized network ensures that the DApp is secure and decentralized.

DApps offer many advantages, such as being open, transparent, and resistant to censorship or interference. They are also powerful tools for building applications that can be accessed and used by anyone, anywhere.

# Chapter 13: The Ethereum Virtual Machine
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment that allows the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It is a sandboxed environment that ensures the security and reliability of the execution of these contracts.

EVM opcodes are the instructions that the EVM can understand and execute. These instructions are used to perform various operations on the Ethereum network, such as storing and retrieving data from storage, sending and receiving Ether, and calling other smart contracts.

Some examples of EVM opcodes include:
- PUSH: This opcode is used to push data onto the stack.
- POP: This opcode is used to pop data off the stack.
- ADD: This opcode is used to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition.
- JUMP: This opcode is used to jump to a specific location in the contract code.

# Chapter 14: Consensus
Blockchain consensus is the process by which a decentralized network of nodes reaches an agreement on the current state of the blockchain. This is necessary to maintain the integrity of the blockchain and ensure that all nodes are in agreement on the current state of the ledger.

Ethereum consensus used a proof-of-work algorithm called ethash to achieve consensus. In this algorithm, nodes compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to earn the right to add a new block to the blockchain.

Ethereum was also working on and has now implemented a new proof-of-stake algorithm called Casper. In this algorithm, nodes with a certain amount of ether can "stake" their ether to validate transactions and earn rewards.

Examples of blockchain consensus in action include the Bitcoin network, where nodes compete to solve puzzles to earn the right to add new blocks to the blockchain, and the Ethereum network, where nodes use ethash to achieve consensus.

# Review Of Five Topics Of Secureum Solidity 201
## 1. Library Restrictions In Solidity:
In Solidity, libraries are a type of contract that cannot be deployed on their own(except it has some external functions), but rather are designed to be used by other contracts. Some restriction of libraries in Solidity is that:
- they cannot have any state variables
- they cannot inherit nor be inherited
- they cannot receive Ether
- they cannot be destroyed
- it can only access state variables of the calling contract if they are explicitly supplied (it would have no way to name them, otherwise)
- Library functions can only be called directly (i.e. without the use of DELEGATECALL) if they do not modify the state (i.e. if they are view or pure functions), because libraries are assumed to be stateless.

This can make it difficult to use libraries for certain types of functionality, but it also helps to ensure that they are lightweight and efficient.

## 2. EVM Storage:
EVM Storage is a key-value store that maps 256-bit words to 256-bit words and can be accessed using the SSTORE and SLOAD instructions in EVM. It is a persistent storage space where each contract's data can be read, written, modified, and saved. Until they are written to, all storage locations are initialized to zero.

## 3. Storage Layout:
A contract's storage layout in Solidity refers to how its data is structured in EVM storage. Furthermore, state variables of a contract in solidity are stored in a compact manner, so that multiple values can be stored in the same storage slot or position when applicable, beginning with storage position zero (0) for the first state variable, and so on.

## 4. Reserved Memory:
Solidity reserves four 32-byte slots, which are used to perform certain actions in memory on the EVM. They are:
- 0x00 - 0x3f (64 bytes): scratch space for hashing methods(32 bytes * 2)
- 0x40 - 0x5f (32 bytes): currently allocated memory size (aka. free memory pointer)
- 0x60 - 0x7f (32 bytes): zero slot (The zero slot is used as initial value for dynamic memory arrays and should never be written to)

## 5. Zero Address Check:
Address(0), which is 20 bytes of 0s, is treated differently in Solidity contracts because the private key associated with this address is unknown. Ether and tokens sent to this address are unrecoverable, and setting access control roles for this address is also ineffective (no private key to sign transactions). As a result, zero addresses should be used with caution, and checks for user-supplied address parameters should be implemented.
